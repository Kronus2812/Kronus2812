# Hello! I'm Tomas Martinez

Full Stack Developer from Bogotá, Colombia, focused on building practical solutions with clean, efficient code. I work across the entire stack, from database design and backend APIs to responsive frontends and data visualization.

I specialize in creating systems that solve real-world problems: access control platforms for airport security, analytics dashboards for sales teams, and interactive web applications. My approach combines solid fundamentals in software architecture with hands-on experience in PHP, Python, JavaScript, and SQL.

I'm passionate about clean code, scalable architecture, and continuous learning. Currently exploring advanced design patterns, API optimization, and modern frontend frameworks while contributing to open-source projects.

**Stack:** PHP · Python · JavaScript · React · Node.js · MySQL · PostgreSQL · HTML/CSS · SASS · Git
